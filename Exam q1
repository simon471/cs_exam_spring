1)  Consider the following class:

--------------------------------------------------------
public class Technology{
   
  String name;
  
  public Technology(String name){
    this.name=name;}
    
  public void speak(){
    System.out.println("Bleep, blip.  I am a " + name);}
    
---------------------------------------------------------    

a)  Write a subclass to Technology with a class called Smartphone.
    Add an additional integer field called number.
    Include a constructor for Smartphone that takes the "name" and "number" as parameters
    
    
Ans:
public class Smartphone extends Technology{
  
  int number;
  
  public Smartphone(String name, int number){
    super(name);
    this.number = number;
  }
  public void speak(){
    System.out.println("Bleep, blip.  I am a " + name + " and the number is " + number + ".");
}
  
}




b)  Explain what INHERITANCE is.

Ans:
It means that the subclass inherit the superclass's fields and methods.


c)  Write a "speak" method for Smartphone that states the "name" and "number". 


d)  What is this called when we write a subclass method which overrides a super class method?

Ans:
Polymorphism
